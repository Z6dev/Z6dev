Just a **13-yo** who loves to **Code**, alas dont expect much from my code Quality.   
I also really Like **Game Development**. I made some games, like those on my Gamejolt. But you know those are **HOT GARBAGE**!!!!!  
Buuutttttt, I'm also currently working on a game Made in C!!! I hope I can finish it though.   

Oh! And I use Debian!   
so If I ever makes some stuff windows support may come later or even never. (I hope not)

## 🖥 Things I love:
- Game Development!!!!!!
- Low Level Programming (Anything for that sweet sweet FPS)
- Making Useless Trash without Purpose. Could say most of it was scrapped after a few days.
- Graphics. For whatever reason, It just gives me a dopamine boost.
