Just a **13-year-old coder** who loves to **code**, **create**, and occasionally set my computer on fire 🔥.   
I really Love **Game Development**. I made some games, like those on my Gamejolt. But you know those are **HOT GARBAGE**!!!!!  

---

## 🖥 Things I love:
- Game Development, atleast the coding side. (I suck at art, A LOT)
- Making Useless Trash without Purpose. Could say most of it was scrapped after a few days.
- Graphics. For whatever reason, It just gives me a dopamine boost.

## 🌱 Currently Learning:
- Web Development (I have trouble keeping up with the new hypes 🐌)
- Low-Level Stuff, I find Tinkering stuff fun.

## 🤖 Languages I Use:
`JavaScript` • `Go` • `Python`
 - Although I mostly use Python for automating my school homeworks... Weird, huh?
 - Im trying to learn `C++` though...
